I created two classes--one for the text squares and one for stripe patches--for this artwork. 
A user can choose the font size, color, size, and the location of the text boxes. 
One can also choose the direction--vertically or horizontally--and the speed of the movement.

For the tilted stripe patches, user can choose the density, angle, location, and the direction.
