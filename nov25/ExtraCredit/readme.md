## Process
I carefully read the example we have covered in the recorded lecture and modified the code a little bit. 


## Reflection 
This is the first communication assignment I have done among three and I had a lot of fun!

I think Processing and Arduino complement each other in that Processing provides better visual graphic and Arduino provides more diverse inputs (ex. analog sensors) 

I want to try more complicated types of communications in my final project.
